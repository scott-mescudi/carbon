### **Already Features**:
1. **Expiry Time for Keys**:
   - Users can set an expiry time for individual cache entries, automatically invalidating stale data.

2. **Set, Retrieve, and Delete Keys/Values**:
   - Easy interface to interact with the cache, with standard operations (set, get, delete) for cache management.

3. **Cache Invalidation**:
   - Ability to invalidate the entire cache at once, clearing all cached data in a single operation.

### **Additional Features to Enhance Your Caching System**:

1. **Eviction Policies**:
   - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Automatically evict the least recently accessed items when the cache reaches its memory limit, ensuring that the most frequently used data stays in memory.
   - **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Evict the least frequently accessed items.
   - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Evict the oldest cached items, which can be useful for time-sensitive data.
   - **Custom Eviction Strategy**: Allow users to define custom eviction policies, enabling more control over cache behavior.

2. **Automatic Cache Resizing**:
   - Dynamically adjust the cache size based on available system memory. This helps prevent excessive memory usage and ensures optimal performance.
   
3. **Persistent Storage Integration**:
   - Provide an option for users to back up the cache to persistent storage (e.g., files or databases) so that data isn't lost when the application restarts. This can be particularly useful for caching non-volatile data like configuration settings.

4. **Cache Versioning**:
   - Allow cache versioning so that users can easily invalidate and refresh specific versions of data. This is especially useful when your app or service evolves, and cached data becomes incompatible with the new version.

5. **Cache Statistics/Monitoring**:
   - Include built-in methods to track cache hits, misses, eviction counts, memory usage, and other statistics. This can help users monitor cache efficiency and adjust configuration for better performance.
   - You could also allow logging or visual reporting (in case the cache grows large) to give users insight into cache performance.

6. **Thread-Safety and Concurrency Support**:
   - Ensure that the cache is thread-safe, allowing it to be used safely in multi-threaded environments. You can use locks or more advanced techniques (like read-write locks) to ensure that cache operations do not conflict in concurrent scenarios.
   - Implement atomic operations such as **incrementing** or **decrementing** values in the cache, which can be useful for counters or flags.

7. **TTL Reset on Access (Sliding Expiry)**:
   - Extend the expiry mechanism to support a "sliding" TTL. With sliding expiry, the cache entry’s TTL is reset every time the item is accessed. This ensures that frequently accessed items stay in the cache for longer periods.

8. **Cache Prefetching**:
   - Implement an option for **lazy loading** or **prefetching** data into the cache based on some predefined conditions or access patterns. This can proactively load data into the cache, reducing latency for the next request.

9. **Namespaces**:
   - Allow users to organize cache entries into namespaces or groups. This would allow them to set, retrieve, or delete cache entries within a specific namespace, which is useful for managing caches in larger applications with different types of data.

10. **Distributed Cache Support (if Scaling is Considered)**:
   - Although local caches typically don’t require distribution, if you plan for future scaling or hybrid use cases, you could add support for **distributed cache** systems (e.g., using a local cluster of machines or integrating with external systems like Redis).
   - Implementing **replication** within a local environment could also be an option for users who want to scale across multiple machines.

11. **Custom Serialization/Deserialization**:
   - Allow users to define how cache data is serialized and deserialized. For example, providing hooks to customize how objects are stored in the cache can help with compatibility when caching complex data structures or handling various data formats (JSON, binary, etc.).

12. **Cache Pre-warming**:
   - Provide a feature to **pre-warm** the cache after startup, where the cache is automatically populated with predefined values or a set of commonly accessed data. This reduces initial latency and ensures the cache is ready to serve requests immediately.

13. **Async API Support**:
   - Support **asynchronous operations** for cache interactions, especially useful for web applications where non-blocking operations are critical to maintain high performance under load.
   - Users could perform cache operations without waiting for the response, which can be beneficial when interacting with large amounts of data.

14. **Backup and Restore**:
   - Enable users to easily **back up** the cache to disk and **restore** it later. This is particularly useful for long-running applications or environments where the cache might store a significant amount of important, non-volatile data.

15. **Expiration Callbacks (on Expiry)**:
   - Allow users to set **callback functions** that are triggered when a cache item expires. This can be helpful for automatically reloading data into the cache or logging expiry events.

16. **Cache Warm-Up for Expired Keys**:
   - Implement automatic "cache warm-up" where expired keys are proactively re-fetched or refreshed in the background once they are invalidated. This can help ensure the cache is refreshed without the user experiencing a delay in retrieval when accessing expired data.

17. **Integrated Caching Strategies**:
   - Provide out-of-the-box caching strategies like **write-through**, **write-behind**, or **cache-aside**. These strategies can allow the cache to interact intelligently with your underlying data source (e.g., a database), depending on how users want to manage consistency between the cache and the source data.
